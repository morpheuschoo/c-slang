TODO:

- Expression vs Statement (Value producing vs non-value producing)
- = should return the value of the right hand subexpression and assign
  - so something like f1(x = 2) should work
  - https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html
  - x = 2; should be an expressionStatement not a MemoryStore
  - so it should start from an expressionStatement and then x = 2 and a POP
- Compound statements?
- no difference between int x = 1 and x = 1 (need to make a distinction)
- declarations need to be added 
- malloc and free still have a bit of problems (Error: Type mismatch: Cannot store integer in pointer memory location)
  - Something to do with MemoryStore
- for loops
- array calculations have a bit of problem (BinaryOp with LocalAddress)

NOTE:
- Pointer 4 bytes
